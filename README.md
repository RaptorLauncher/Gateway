# Gateway

Gateway is a movement and a project to create a service for cooperative storywriting and textual roleplaying that is free software and belongs to the community.

## Current state

We are currently in the state of gathering ideas for what a good or better roleplaying service should look like and involve, and implementing the basics of the UI and the backend.
